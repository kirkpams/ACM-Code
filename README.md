The following documents are drafts of case studies to use with the ACM Code of
Ethics. The goal for these case studies is to develop materials that can be used
to integrate ethical reasoning skills into mainstream Computer Science courses,
such as Operating Systems or Databases. All materials are free to use and adapt
according to the terms of the MIT License.

Disclaimer: Many of these case studies are inspired by real events. The case
narratives may include slightly altered or exaggerated versions of events for
the purposes of increasing the discussion. These alterations are NOT intended as
